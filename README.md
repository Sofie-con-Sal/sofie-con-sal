## Hi there 👋 
This is the first draft of my personal website. 
The background is a photo I took on my camera (Olympus OM-2 using Ilford ORTHO Plus 80 film). 
Red waves were created on Figma. Top lefthand logo was created using ProCreate. 
Still have to upload short stories, link my substack, and upload .FBX files created on Blender.
